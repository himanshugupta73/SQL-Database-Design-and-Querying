# SQL Database Design and Querying Project

This project showcases relational database design, SQL querying, and schema management using a combination of custom-designed tables and the Maven Movies (Sakila) sample database.

##  Objective

To apply core SQL concepts by:
- Designing normalized relational schemas
- Writing advanced queries using JOINs, GROUP BY, and constraints
- Practicing with a real-world-style dataset (Maven Movies)

##  Project Files

├── final_assignment.sql # Custom schema and queries
├── Mavenmovies.sql # Full sample database
├── SQL_Project_Report.pdf # Summary report
├── README.md # This documentation


##  Technologies Used

- MySQL / PostgreSQL
- SQL Workbench / DBeaver
- Sakila-based Maven Movies Dataset

##  Key Features

- Custom database with employees, products, orders, students, etc.
- Applied constraints: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK, DEFAULT
- Joins and aggregations to derive insights (total sales, order history)
- Used views, subqueries, and groupings

##  Sample Queries

- Total sales per product
- Orders with and without products
- Join across `orders`, `customers`, `products`
- Revenue per film from Maven Movies DB

##  Learning Outcomes

- Mastered SQL DDL and DML operations
- Practiced business-level query solving
- Understood relational database normalization (1NF–3NF)

##  ER Diagram

*(Include ER diagram if available)*
